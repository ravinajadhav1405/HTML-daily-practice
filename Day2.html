  <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a enthusiastic beginner developer skilled in HTML and CSS,
        with a strong belief in consistency and disciplined growth.  
        Alongside technology, I actively participate in cultural and c
        reative activities, which help me stay confident and expressive.
        I also maintain an active fitness routine, as I believe physical

        improvement and a balanced lifestyle shapes both my personal and professional journey.</p>
